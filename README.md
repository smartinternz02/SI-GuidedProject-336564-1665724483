Traffic Volume Estimation using IBM Watson Machine Learning
overview:
Growth in the number of vehicles and degree of urbanization means that the annual cost of 
traffic jams is increasing in cities. This leads to a decrease in the quality of life among citizens 
through a considerable waste of time and excessive fuel consumption and air pollution in 
congested areas Traffic congestion has been one of the major issues that most metropolises are 
facing despite measures being taken to mitigate and reduce it. The safe and time-efficient 
movement of the people and goods is dependent on Traffic flow, which is directly connected 
to the traffic characteristics. Early analysis of congestion events and prediction of traffic 
volumes is a crucial step to identify traffic bottlenecks, which can be utilized to assist traffic 
management centres.
